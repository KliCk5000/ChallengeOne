- Build a two column layout with a navbar.
 The page should be inside a container that has 30px of margin on both side.

- Each column should be half the size of the parent container. 
When the window reaches 768px or less, the right column should 
drop underneath the 1st creating two full-width columns.

- The left column should have an <h1>, <h2>, and a <p>. 
Put some dummy text inside here.

- The right column should have a radio button, regular button, 
and three checkboxes.

- The navbar at the top that spans the full-width of the container. 
On the right side of the nav, it should say your name. 
On the left side of the container, there should be a list with 3 items: 
Home, About, and Contact (they don't need to link anywhere). 
They should all display on one line.

- When the page is above 768px:
   -- The navbar should be green; Otherwise it should be orange.
   -- The left column <p> should be font-size: 10px. 
   Achieve this without putting a class on the <p> tag.
